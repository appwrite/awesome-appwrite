# Contributing

We would ‚ù§Ô∏è for you to contribute to Appwrite and help make it better! We want contributing to Appwrite to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone and everyone. All contributions are welcome, including issues, new docs as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts, workshops, and more.

## How to Start?

If you are worried or don‚Äôt know where to start, check out our next section explaining what kind of help we could use and where can you get involved. You can reach out with questions to [Eldad Fux (@eldadfux)](https://twitter.com/eldadfux) or [@appwrite_io](https://twitter.com/appwrite_io) on Twitter, and anyone from the [Appwrite team on Discord](https://discord.gg/GSeTUeA). You can also submit an issue, and a maintainer can guide you!

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep Appwrite open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Submit a Pull Request üöÄ

Branch naming convention is as following

`TYPE-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

example:

```
doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide
```

When `TYPE` can be:

- **feat** - is a new feature
- **doc** - documentation only changes
- **cicd** - changes related to CI/CD system
- **fix** - a bug fix
- **refactor** - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

**All PRs must include a commit message with the changes description!**

For the initial start, fork the project and use git clone command to download the repository to your computer. A standard procedure for working on an issue would be to:

1. `git pull`, before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.

```
$ git pull
```

2. Create new branch from `master` like: `doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide`<br/>

```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

3. Work - commit - repeat ( be sure to be in your branch )

4. Push changes to GitHub

```
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

5. Submit your changes for review
   If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
6. Start a Pull Request
   Now submit the pull request and click on `Create pull request`.
7. Get a code review approval/reject
8. After approval, merge your PR
9. GitHub will automatically delete the branch after the merge is done. (they can still be restored).

## Introducing New Features

We would üíñ you to contribute to Appwrite, but we would also like to make sure Appwrite is as great as possible and loyal to its vision and mission statement üôè.

For us to find the right balance, please open an issue explaining your ideas before introducing a new pull request.

This will allow the Appwrite community to have sufficient discussion about the new feature value and how it fits in the product roadmap and vision.

This is also important for the Appwrite lead developers to be able to give technical input and different emphasis regarding the feature design and architecture. Some bigger features might need to go through our [RFC process](https://github.com/appwrite/rfc).

## Other Ways to Help

Pull requests are great, but there are many other areas where you can help Appwrite.
