# API: Historical Figures 

An API built in Appwrite using HTML,CSS & Node.js

This is an API that provides the user with information regarding "Historical Figures".
It mainly returns 3 value fields which are; "Name", "Existence" & Country of Origin

This is my project link: https://github.com/DeathRaven1051/Appwrite_API 

The frontend is nothing but a simple and static web page built via HTML & CSS

On submitting the "API" button, the user is directed to the actual API wherein the data is displayed in 
a JSON format. 

The API data is stored in Appwrite's database:

When the api is requested, Appwrite responds to the call. The call can be checked via the field marked 
as "Requests".
