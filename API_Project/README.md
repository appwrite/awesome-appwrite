# pokemon-api-appwrite

A simple Pokemon API made using Appwrite. The web application uses the features of database and API keys which Appwrite provides. 

The database holds the collections for all the data and the API key is then used to access the database and return the data when the route is hit in our Node application. 

The link for my project is available at https://github.com/PyroCandy/pokemon-api-appwrite

The frontend of the application is made by using HTML5 and CSS3 and is responsive.

On hitting the /pokemon route the application grabs data from the Appwrite database and returns it to the user.

The data is stored in the Appwrite database in the form of a collection as shown below.

You can also verify this by checking the Appwrite dashboard which is updated as and when the API is called.
